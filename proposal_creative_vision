CREATIVE VISION: Future Improvements for File Tinder
=====================================================

This document outlines improvements, quality-of-life features, and UI changes
that would enhance the tool. Organized by category with priority levels.


I. WORKFLOW IMPROVEMENTS
========================

1. Drag-and-Drop File Assignment (High Priority)
   Drag a file card directly onto a folder button in the grid.
   Instant visual feedback (folder glows on hover), no clicks needed.
   Works in both Advanced and AI modes.

2. Multi-Select File Operations (High Priority)
   Select multiple files in the file list (Shift+click, Ctrl+click).
   Apply the same decision to all selected at once.
   Useful for batch-assigning files to the same folder.

3. Undo History Panel (Medium Priority)
   Expandable panel showing the last N actions with timestamps.
   Click any entry to undo back to that point (multi-step undo).
   Currently undo is one-at-a-time via stack.

4. File Comparison View (Medium Priority)
   When a duplicate is detected, show a side-by-side diff.
   For images: visual comparison. For text: content diff.
   For binaries: metadata comparison (date, size, hash).

5. Session Persistence Across App Restarts (Low Priority)
   Currently sessions are tied to a single launch.
   Allow resuming a partially-completed sorting session.
   Show "Resume Session" option on launcher for interrupted sessions.


II. AI MODE ENHANCEMENTS
=========================

6. Confidence Score Display (High Priority)
   Show the AI's confidence percentage next to each folder suggestion.
   Color-code: green (>80%), yellow (50-80%), red (<50%).
   Let users set a minimum confidence threshold.

7. Learning from User Corrections (High Priority)
   Track when users override AI suggestions in semi mode.
   Build a local feedback file that improves future sorting.
   "The user moved X to Y instead of AI-suggested Z" patterns.

8. Template Presets (Medium Priority)
   Pre-built sorting templates: "Downloads Cleanup", "Photo Organization",
   "Development Project", "Music Library", "Document Archive".
   Each template includes folder structure + folder purpose prompts.

9. AI Reasoning Panel (Medium Priority)
   A collapsible side panel showing the AI's reasoning for the current file.
   Already stored in suggestions_.reasoning but not surfaced in the UI.
   Show what the AI determined about the file's identity and category.

10. Incremental Learning Cache (Low Priority)
    Cache file-type identifications locally (hash -> identity).
    Skip re-analyzing files the AI has seen before.
    Speeds up re-runs and saves API costs.


III. UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS
========================

11. Dark/Light Theme Toggle (High Priority)
    Currently hardcoded dark theme only.
    Add a light theme option. Store preference in database.
    Some users prefer light themes for readability.

12. File Preview Enhancements (High Priority)
    Audio files: play a short preview (first 10 seconds).
    PDF: show first page thumbnail via poppler or similar.
    Video: show thumbnail frame at 25% mark.
    Code/text: syntax highlighting in the preview panel.

13. Progress Ring Instead of Bar (Medium Priority)
    Replace the thin progress bar with a circular progress indicator.
    Show percentage in the center. More visually appealing.
    Especially useful for the AI analysis progress dialog.

14. Keyboard-First Navigation (Medium Priority)
    Tab through grid folders, arrow keys to navigate.
    Space to select/assign. Full keyboard-only workflow.
    Important for power users who don't want to touch the mouse.

15. Customizable Color Coding (Low Priority)
    Let users assign colors to folders or file types.
    Grid folders could have custom background colors.
    File cards could be tinted by type (green=images, blue=docs, etc).

16. Responsive Layout (Low Priority)
    Auto-adjust grid columns and button sizes based on window size.
    Currently fixed sizes that may not suit all screen resolutions.
    Mobile-friendly layout for smaller screens.


IV. DATA AND ANALYTICS
=======================

17. Sorting Statistics Dashboard (Medium Priority)
    Historical view: how many files sorted per session, over time.
    Category breakdown: which folders get the most files.
    AI accuracy tracking: how often users accept AI suggestions.

18. Export Session Report (Medium Priority)
    Generate a summary of what was sorted where (CSV or HTML).
    Useful for documentation: "here's what I organized today".
    Include before/after folder structure visualization.

19. Duplicate Intelligence (Low Priority)
    Beyond name+size matching, add content hashing (MD5/SHA).
    Suggest keeping the newest or largest version.
    Group duplicates for batch decision-making.


V. INTEGRATION AND EXTENSIBILITY
=================================

20. Plugin System for Custom Rules (Low Priority)
    User-defined sorting rules: "if filename contains X, move to Y".
    Regex-based pattern matching for automatic categorization.
    Could work alongside AI mode or independently.

21. Cloud Storage Integration (Low Priority)
    Support sorting files from Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive.
    Read-only scan + move operations via API.
    Would require OAuth integration per provider.

22. Command-Line Interface (Low Priority)
    Non-GUI mode for scripted/automated sorting.
    `file-tinder --auto --folder ~/Downloads --config preset.json`
    Useful for cron jobs or CI/CD file organization.
